Ossence — Terms of Use
Effective Date: August 6, 2025
<br>
Last Updated: August 6, 2025
<br><br>
1. Acceptance of Terms <br>
By accessing or using the Ossence website (“the Site”), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use. 
If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the Site immediately.
<br><br>
2. Nature of the Service <br>
Ossence is a content-curated affiliate interface. It provides users with convenient access to affiliate links 
that redirect to third-party platforms offering products or services.
<br>
Important: Ossence is not an e-commerce vendor, merchant, or financial intermediary. 
All transactions, data collection, disputes, shipping, warranties, or refunds are managed exclusively by 
the respective third-party merchants.
<br><br>
3. Personal Data and Cookies <br>
We do not request or collect any personal data from users directly. However, by clicking on affiliate links, 
third-party platforms may use cookies or tracking mechanisms to register the referral for commission purposes. 
These processes are governed by the respective third-party privacy policies.
Ossence does not control, access, or store such data, and no login or user account is required to use this website.
<br>
You are not required to register, sign in, or input any personally identifiable information to use this site.
<br><br>
4. Third-Party Responsibility Disclaimer <br>
By clicking on affiliate links, you acknowledge and agree that: <br>

You are being redirected to external platforms not owned or operated by Ossence.
<br>
Ossence is not responsible for the quality, reliability, legality, safety, accuracy, 
or fulfillment of any third-party content, product, or service. <br>

Ossence shall not be liable for any dissatisfaction, inconvenience, or monetary loss arising from your interaction 
with third-party websites. <br>

In other words: We do not sell or ship anything. We merely point you toward publicly available affiliate deals. <br>
<br>
5. No Guarantees or Warranties <br>
All content on this site is provided “as-is” and “as-available,” without warranties of any kind — express or implied.
<br>
We do not guarantee:
<br>
That any affiliate offer is still valid, up-to-date, or available in your location.
<br>
That any third-party merchant will meet your expectations or deliver as promised.
<br>
Use of the site is entirely at your own risk.
<br><br>
6. User Conduct <br>
By using the Site, you agree not to:
<br>
Use the site for any illegal, harmful, or deceptive purpose.
<br>
Attempt to reverse engineer, disrupt, exploit, or interfere with the affiliate tracking systems.
<br>
Impersonate others or misuse affiliate links for unlawful gain.
<br><br>
7. Intellectual Property <br>
All product names, logos, images, trademarks, and affiliate content remain the property of 
their respective owners. Ossence does not claim ownership or endorsement unless explicitly stated.
<br>
Use of such materials is for identification and navigational purposes only under fair-use and affiliate program permissions.
<br><br>
8. Limitation of Liability <br>
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law:
<br>
Ossence and its operators shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or exemplary damages, 
including but not limited to dissatisfaction, product complaints, delivery issues, refund disputes, or price changes, 
arising out of or in connection with your use of the Site.
<br>
This limitation applies even if we were advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br><br>
9. Indemnification <br>
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Ossence, its creator(s), affiliates, and partners from any claims, liabilities, 
damages, costs, or legal fees arising from your use of the Site or breach of these Terms.
<br><br>
10. Governing Law <br>
These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Croatia, 
without regard to conflict-of-law principles.
<br>
Any disputes shall be resolved exclusively in competent courts located in Zagreb, Croatia.
<br><br>
11. Changes to Terms <br>
Ossence reserves the right to update or modify these Terms of Use at any time without notice. 
Continued use of the site implies acceptance of the current version.
<br><br>
12. Final Disclaimer <br>
If you are dissatisfied with a product, price, delivery, description, or merchant conduct, you must contact 
the third-party platform directly. Ossence provides navigation, not negotiation.
